# BlowUpPlanets
Defend your planet from the asteroid bombardment.

1. Tap to destroy asteroids before they wipe out civilisation, and expose the molten core to space.
2. Large asteroids will fragment into smaller ones, resulting in surface bombardment.
3. Collisions will collapse the crust of the planet.
4. Collisions will cause the planet to spin wildly, making tactical choices difficult.
5. Cities are built over time. Cities will save the crust from collapsing.
